    We are extremely excited to ship this latest major update to all of our users.
    With this release, we are adding a large pool of 900+ icons to our last release of Emblemicons. 
    Today, our users have a choice to choose and download an icon for free for personal and commercial use from a wide variety of 1000+ icons.

<h2 class="pb-2" style="color: #000ed3;">An open-source library of 1000+ icons</h2>
<p class="text-justify pb-2" style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: #333333;">
    A few months back, we started the Emblemicons project journey with a simple idea to build an open-source library of most commonly and frequently used icons in digital products and share it with the world. 
    <b>Today, we are extremely happy to share an open-source library of 1000+ icons with the world.</b> 
    Two weeks back, when we released the first version of Emblemicons, we had only 114 icons.
    <b>With this release, we are making available another 900+ icons, taking us to a total of 1000+ icons, which are available for free use and download now.</b> 
    <br>
    <br>
    In this release, we are making available icons in outline and filled themes. 
    You will also find a good number of icons drawn and designed in circle and square themes. 
    We have drawn and designed icons of different categories, like arrow, content, file, folders, mobile device, social media, navigation and so on, covering the most commonly used icons in digital product design.

<h2 class="pb-2" style="color: #000ed3;">Figma file</h2>
<p class="text-justify pb-2" style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: #333333;">
    We have used <a href="https://www.figma.com" target="_blank">Figma</a> as the primary design tool to draw all of the 1000+ icons. 
    <b>In order to share Emblemicons with a large community of our users, we have published the Figma file containing all the 1000+ icons, and it is available for free on Figma community for anyone.</b> 
    If you are a Figma user, you can <a href="https://wwww.figma.com" target="_blank"> duplicate the Emblemicons Figma file</a> and use it for your personal, academic and business projects.
</p>
<h2 class="pb-2" style="color: #000ed3;">Free for use and download</h2>
<p class="text-justify pb-1" style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: #333333;">
    We have covered a wide variety of file formats for different use scenarios. 
    For your blog posts, social media, business presentations, academic projects and so on, you can download the PNG and JPG files.
    For using the icons in your software development, product design or product development projects, you can download the SVG file and style it with CSS as per your requirements. You can also copy the HTML code and use it directly in your projects.
</p>
<p class="text-justify pb-1" style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: #333333;">
    <b>In Emblemicons, you can do the following with every icon:</b>
</p>
<ul class="pb-2" style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: #333333;">
    <li><i>You can download PNG and JPG images in 6 available sizes (12px, 18px, 24px, 36px, 48px, 72px).</i></li>
    <li><i>You can download SVG file and style it with CSS.</i></li>
    <li><i>You can download PDF file too.</i></li>
    <li><i>You can copy the HTML code and use in your projects directly.</i></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-justify pb-1" style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: #333333;">
    We have also talked about this feature in our <a href="{{ "/blog/2020/08/30/a-warm-welcome-to-emblemicons-1.0.0" | relative_url }}" target="_blank">first blog post</a>.

<h2 class="pb-2" style="color: #000ed3;">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p class="text-justify pb-2" style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: #333333;">
    We said in our <a href="{{ "/blog/2020/08/30/a-warm-welcome-to-emblemicons-1.0.0" | relative_url }}" target="_blank">first blog post</a> that we are building Emblemicons brick by brick. 
    <b>With today's release, we are making available an open-source library of 1000+ icons.</b> 
    We will be adding more icons to the library in our next release.
    <b>Simultaneously, we will be working on optimization of icons, improvement of user experience, to name a few and will release our updates in coming days.</b> 
    Stay tuned with us.
