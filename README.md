## The motivation behind Emblemicons
Emblemicons was born with a simple idea to build an open-source library of most commonly and frequently used icons in digital products and share it with the world.
With our analysis, we were suprised to find that the process to find and download a basic commonly used icon from web involves too many steps and it was time-consuming.
Emblemicons was born as a weekend-project to make the most commonly and frequently used icons available for free. You can use these icons in product development, product design, software development, business presentations, academic projects, to name a few. It is completely free for personal and commercial use.
